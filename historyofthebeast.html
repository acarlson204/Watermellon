            <h3>The watermellons are a tale almost as old as time..</h3>
            <p><strong>Watermelon</strong> (Citrullus lanatus) is a flowering plant species of the
                Cucurbitaceae
                family.<br>A scrambling and trailing vine-like plant, it was originally domesticated
                in
                Africa. It is a highly cultivated fruit worldwide, with more than 1,000 varieties.

                Wild watermelon seeds have been found in the prehistoric Libyan site of Uan
                Muhuggiag. There is also evidence from seeds in Pharaoh tombs of watermelon
                cultivation in Ancient Egypt.</p>
            <p></p>
            In the 7th century, watermelons were being cultivated in India, and by the 10th
            century
            had reached China, which is today the world's single largest watermelon
            producer. The Moors introduced the fruit into the Iberian Peninsula and there is
            evidence of it being cultivated in CÃ³rdoba in 961 and also in Seville in 1158. It
            spread
            northwards through southern Europe, perhaps limited in its advance by summer
            temperatures being insufficient for good yields. The fruit had begun appearing in
            European herbals by 1600, and was widely planted in Europe in the 17th century as a
            minor garden crop.</p>
            <p></p>
            watermelon, a fruit long correlated with laziness and uncleanliness.

            Seedless watermelons were initially developed in 1939 by Japanese scientists who were
            able to create seedless triploid hybrids which remained rare initially because they did
            not have sufficient disease resistance. Seedless watermelons became more popular in
            the 21st century, rising to nearly 85% of total watermelon sales in the United States in
            2014. </p>
